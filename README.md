# Weather Forecast Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a Weather Forecast web application developed as part of an academic assignment. The application allows users to check real-time weather information by entering a city name or by using their current location. It displays current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast in a clean and responsive interface.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate API integration, JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – for structuring the web pages  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) – for layout and responsive design  
- Vanilla CSS – for custom styling and background effects  
- JavaScript  – for fetching API data and handling application logic  
- OpenWeatherMap API – for retrieving weather data

## Features
- Search weather by city name  
- Get weather using current location (Geolocation API)  
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition  
- 5-day weather forecast  
- Temperature unit conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit)  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens  
- Error handling for invalid city names or empty input

## Setup Instructions
1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `README.md`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
4. Make sure you have an active internet connection to fetch weather data from the API.

No additional installations or frameworks are required, as Tailwind CSS is included using a CDN.

## API Information
This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The API is accessed using JavaScript `fetch()` with proper error handling.  
The API key is used directly in the JavaScript file for academic and learning purposes only.
This project was developed for academic purposes.
